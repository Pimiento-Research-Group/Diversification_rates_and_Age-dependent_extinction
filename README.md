## Usage notes

The PyRate program is required for a portion of the analyses in this study, the program and the instruction on how to compile it can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/dsilvestro/PyRate).

1. [**PyRate input step 1.**](https://github.com/Pimiento-Research-Group/Diversification_rates_and_Age-dependent_extinction/blob/master/code/1.pyrate_input_step1.py)
  - filters the FINS dataset to produce a .txt file usable by the PyRate program, for an example of a PyRate input file see [this repository](https://github.com/dsilvestro/PyRate/wiki/1.-Preparing-input-file)
  - *input* - Occurrences data from the FINS Dataset openly accessible [here](https://zenodo.org/uploads/13983668)
  - *output* - .txt file formatted according to PyRate requirements
  - *alternative output* - if `adenn = True` argument is used, this script generates a .txt input file needed for the ADE-NN analyses
2. [**PyRate input step 2.**](https://github.com/Pimiento-Research-Group/Diversification_rates_and_Age-dependent_extinction/blob/master/code/2.pyrate_input_step2.R)
  - converts the .txt file generated in Script 1. to a *_PyRate.py file readable by the PyRate program
  - the function in this script assigns an age to each occurrence randomy sampled from a uniform distribution delimited by the minimum and maximum age of the occurrence, for details see [this repository](https://github.com/dsilvestro/PyRate/wiki/1.-Preparing-input-file)
  - in our analyses we created an input file with 10 replicates of sampled ages
  - *input* - .txt file generated by Script 1.
  - *output* - *_PyRate.py file and a *_TaxonList.txt file containing a list of all unique taxa in the input file with the respective extinct/extant status. The taxon list file is not used in any further analyses here, but can be useful for data exploration. 
  - *Note*: As the process of the *_PyRate.py file creation has an element of stochasticity, we provide the files generated and used in subsequent analyses of this study in the [/data/ folder](https://github.com/Pimiento-Research-Group/Diversification_rates_and_Age-dependent_extinction/tree/master/data) in this repository, for the purpose of reproducibility
3. **PyRate Analyses**<br />
- 3.1. [**Rate calculation**](https://github.com/Pimiento-Research-Group/Diversification_rates_and_Age-dependent_extinction/blob/master/code/3.1.calculate_rates.sh)
    - estimates extinction, speciation and net diversification rates
    - the script is provided in a form of a shell script which can be submitted to a HPC Cluster, however it can also be ran locally by only running the final line of the script without the `srun` command and providing a replicate number for the `-j` argument
    - we used the following settings:
        - `-n` 50000000 - number of generations
        - `-s` 1000 - sample every 1000th generation
        - `-qShift` /path/to/ages.txt - allow peservation rate to vary in each geological stage (requires a .txt file, see *input* below)
        - `-min_dt` 0.5 - look for a rate shift every 0.5 Myr
        - `-mG`- allow preservation rate to vary amongst taxa
        - `-pP` 2 0 - prior for the gamma distribution of preservation rates
        - `-fast_burnin` 25000 -
        - `-fQ` 0.05 -
        - `-fU` 0.05 0.2 0 - 
        - `-singleton` 1 - excludes singletons, used in the main analysis and omitted in supplementary analysis
        - an overview of other PyRate settings can be accessed [here](https://github.com/dsilvestro/PyRate/wiki/2.-PyRate:-command-list#main-analysis-settings)
    - *input* - *_PyRate.py file generated in Script 2. and a .txt file containing starting and ending points of geological stages in Myr, which is provided [here](https://github.com/Pimiento-Research-Group/Diversification_rates_and_Age-dependent_extinction/tree/master/data) as ages.txt, this file is required for the `-qShift` parameter
    - *output* - for each replicate produced in Script 2. the following files are generated - *_ex_rates.log, *_sp_rates.log, *_mcmc.log and *_sum.txt, here we had 10 replicates, so 40 output files in total are produced

- 3.2. [**Output processing**](https://github.com/Pimiento-Research-Group/Diversification_rates_and_Age-dependent_extinction/blob/master/code/3.2.process_pyrate_output.sh)
  1. Combine the .log files into a single set of posterior values using the `-combLogRJ` command.
     - *input* - a path to the directory where the outputs from Script 3.1. are saved
     - *output* - 3 files - combined_10_mcmc.log, combined_10_ex_rates.log and combined_10_sp_rates.log
  2. Generate an .r script containing the mean rates and 95% CIs required for calculations and plotting using the `-plotRJ` command. This script also generates a default PyRate plot of the rates.
     - the following setting were used:
       - `-tag` combined - only use the combined posteriors, if not used a plot will be generated for each mcmc.log file in the directory
       - `-grid_plot` 0.1 - calculate the rate for each 0.1 Myr 
       - `-b` 0.1 - treat the first 10% of samples as burnin (ignore them)
     - *input* - a path to the directory where the outputs from Script 3.1. are saved or to the directory where the combined files are saved, if different
     - *output* - RTT_plots.r script and a .pdf plot
  3. Estimate speciation and extinction times using the `-ginput` command
     - *input* - combined_10_mcmc.log file
     - *output* - *_se_est.txt file containing the speciation and extinction times in Myr for each taxon in the dataset
- 3.3. [**Output cleaning**](https://github.com/Pimiento-Research-Group/Diversification_rates_and_Age-dependent_extinction/blob/master/code/3.3.clean_pyrate_output.py)
  - this is an optional step created for a scenario in which the formatting of the output files isn't correct, which may happen when using an HPC Cluster (see notes directly in the script)
  - if required, this step should be done before step 3.2.
4. [**Plot the diversification rates**](https://github.com/Pimiento-Research-Group/Diversification_rates_and_Age-dependent_extinction/blob/master/code/4.plot_rates.py)
  - plot diversification rates, produces figures 1., S1, S2 and S3
  - *input* - RTT_plots.r file generated in Script 3.2.
  - *output* - .pdf plots and an .xlsx file containing the rates at each 0.1 Myr
5. [**Find extinction and origination events**](https://github.com/Pimiento-Research-Group/Diversification_rates_and_Age-dependent_extinction/blob/master/code/5.find_ext_events.py)
  - this script prints the time periods in Myrs where the extinction or origination rate reaches the intensity specified
  - the intesity of interest is defined in the `time_ext[rate_ext > 3*harm_mean]` line, here we looked for events of moderate intesity (i.e. at least 3 times higher than background), and intense intesity (i.e. at least 6 times higher than background, `time_ext[rate_ext > 6*harm_mean]`)
  - *input* - RTT_plots.r file generated in Script 3.2.
  - *output* - Myrs during which the desired level of rate intensity was reached, these will be printed in the console
